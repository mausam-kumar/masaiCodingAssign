1. Hoisting: When we execute a piece of JavaScript code, the JavaScript engine creates the global execution context.
            The global execution context has two phases: creation and execution.During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. This feature is known as hoisting in JavaScript.


2. Stack: With the help of stack javascript keep track of what to do next

3. declaration: The   var and   function are declaration
                statementsâ€”they declare or define variables and functions.
                These statements define identifiers (variable and function names) that
                can be used elsewhere in your program and assign values to those
                identifiers.

4. reassignment: After declaring the variable or function changing its whole refrence value is call reassignment\
                for example:
                var string = "mausam"
                string = "Dell"
                this is called ressignment

5. mutability: Abality of Changing the value of the variable after assigning it is called mutablity. in javascript
               primitive  datatype like string , number, boolean etc are immutable while array and object are mutable.
